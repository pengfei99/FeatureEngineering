# Feature store introduction

## What is a Feature Store?

A feature store is essentially a **data management system for managing machine learning features, feature engineering 
code, and data**. With a Feature Store, machine learning pipelines and online applications have easy access to that 
data. Data scientists can focus on training and retraining models with the most up-to-date features, rather than 
needing to constantly rebuild features for new models.

## Why are Feature Stores Important?

A feature store creates a central place where different teams within an organization can share, build, and manage 
features – preventing the need to rebuild the same features. This allows organizations to save time, resources, 
ensure consistency of information, and scale their AI.

It’s not surprising that feature stores now play a vital role in modern machine learning. By automating and 
centrally managing the data processes powering operational machine learning models, feature stores facilitate 
the development and deployment of features quickly and reliably.

## How to Choose a Feature Store?

Data scientists, ML Engineers, Dev Ops, and data engineers should all have the ability to find features, reuse 
them in new applications, and visualize statistics on data. It’s also important that your feature store includes 
robust data transformation capabilities, so your team can easily aggregate, join, filter, and manipulate data.
